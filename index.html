            The dataset contains a variety of information, which can be divided into two macro-categories: the first
            category refers to the physical characteristics of individual trees, such as species, height, crown size
            and position. The second, on the other hand, exploits precise methodologies that use the physical
            characteristics of the tree to estimate secondary information such as carbon dioxide captured, pollution
            removed, energy saved, and money saved.<br><br>
            Our goal is to rework the dataset and develop a series of graphical representations of the data that
            will allow for easier and faster reading of the findings.
