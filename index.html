                    Since 1996, the municipality of Trento has been carrying out surveys of green areas and street trees

                    size
                    and position. The second, on the other hand, exploits precise methodologies that use the physical
                    characteristics of the tree to estimate secondary information such as carbon dioxide captured,
                    pollution
                    removed, energy saved, and money saved.<br><br>

                carried
                out at different times. The surveys and updates of green areas are being completed and therefore the
                data and gardens reported are still partial or do not entirely correspond to reality.<br><br>
                The dataset contains a variety of information, which can be divided into two macro-categories: the
                first
                category refers to the physical characteristics of individual trees, such as species, height, crown
                size
                and position. The second, on the other hand, exploits precise methodologies that use the physical
                characteristics of the tree to estimate secondary information such as carbon dioxide captured,
                pollution
                removed, energy saved, and money saved.<br><br>
                Our goal is to rework the dataset and develop a series of graphical representations of the data that
                will allow for easier and faster reading of the findings.
